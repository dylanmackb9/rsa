# rsa

Implementing a backend to a local public-key RSA encryption cryptosystem for texting. 

Includes functionality for encryption and decryption, send and receive functionality, and public channel with option private moderator.  

# Sequencer/Interpreter 
Sequence from written english to 10-95 numerical sequence and back

# Encoder/Decoder
Returns a sequenced numerical representation of text message or interpreted message

# Extended Euclidean Algorithm
Allows private moderate to calculate private key from large primes 

#Encryption/Decryption
Fast encryption algorithms using python pow() for modular residue calculation
